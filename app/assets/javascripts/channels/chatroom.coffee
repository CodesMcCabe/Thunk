# CLIENT SIDE
# THIS WILL BE A setSocket() METHOD IN COMPONENT

 # this would be called in our handleSubmit function on the frontend

# belive i can build out a FE subscription component withi this channels folder using JS
# would look just like our regular presentational component
# can create a container to set up the state of the chatroom
# state would be pulling in all the messages associated to the chatroom
# QUESTION: is a subscribed user a user that is currently within the chatroom? Or are you always subscribed?
# I think it would be that they need to be within the chatroom.
